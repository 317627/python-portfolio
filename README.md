Project Title: Fake News Detector for Social Media
Problem:I am trying to solve the problem of misinformation spreading quickly on social media platforms like Facebook and X. This matters because fake news can influence public opinion, harm reputations, and affect elections.
Solution:The project uses a machine learning model to analyze the text of news posts and classify them as real or fake. It looks at patterns in language, word frequency, and writing style to make predictions.
Tools: I used Python with libraries like scikit-learn and pandas, and trained the model using a public fake news dataset from Kaggle.
Results:The model achieved 92% accuracy on the test dataset and was able to correctly classify most viral fake headlines.
Learning:I learned that data quality and cleaning are just as important as choosing the right machine learning model.
